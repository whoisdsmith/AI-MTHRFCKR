## Summary

We have seen several tips for getting started with prompt engineering. For a quick recap:

1. Use clear, direct, and concise instructions
2. Try “complete this sentence” prompts for more natural responses
3. Use examples (few-shot learning) of the task
4. Align prompt instructions with a clear end goal
5. Use persona keywords to alter the style and voice of the response
6. Constrain the LLM’s responses by listing desired responses in the prompt
7. Experiment with variations of the prompt to see what works best for you!

Go on and start engineering prompts with these newfound skills and remember that if at first you don’t succeed, try and try (a different variation of a prompt) again!
