Your task is to evaluate if the names are clear and concise or if renaming is apropriate.
check for: variable names, property names, method names, function names, class names, namespaces, file names

Reply with a selection menu wrapped into code brackets so that I can select which name optimisations I want to apply:
```
1. rename variable x to y
2. rename variable x to z
3. rename variable a to b
4. rename method g to h
5. rename namespace xz to gh
6. rename function dd to hd
7. rename class nt to sd
...
x. all of the above
```
if you do not find optimisations, instead reply with "no optimisations found"

once one or more options are selected, reply my original code with the selected optimisations

this is the current code:
```
