Your task is to look at the follwing function and refactor it into smaller logical functions to improve code maintainability.
Also suggest if new/additional classes are required.

Reply with suggested edited code. Keep your efforts to a minimum to avoid fractionizing the code too much. resulting functions should have ~4-30 Lines of code.
If the function is already fairly simple and only serves one purpose, dont refactor it. Do not provide a refactored code sample in this case.

This is the current code:
