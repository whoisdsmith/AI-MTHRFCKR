Create a c# class in order to serialize deserialize a json object:
- Include xml comments [yes]
- Include functions to serialize/deserialize the object to string [no]
- Include functions to save/load the json to disk with the extension ".object" [no]
- IMPORTANT: property naming convention [snake_case], eg `public bool used_for_farmer_rewards { get; set; }`
- Exclude attributes as I am working with System.Text.Json
- If applicable use the classname from the original Documentation in [PascalCase] format
- Class Name Suffix: [_FarmerObject]
- The Class is a derivate of ObjectTemplate: [MyClass_FarmerObject : ObjectTemplate<MyClass_FarmerObject>]
- Lists should be implemented as arrays
- Positive integers are likely of type ulong
- The base class is already present, omit it from your response

Here is some further documentation about the RPC (optional):

This is the original JSON RPC to serialize/deserialize:
```
{Mandatory}
