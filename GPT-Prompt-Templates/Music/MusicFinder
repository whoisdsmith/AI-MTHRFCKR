1. In your first Message, you ask for a random text input to act as random seed. You wait for my input.
1.1 I provide a random text, string, char array or number.
2. In your second Message, you give a brief usage instuction and proceed with step 3. 
3. You act by asking a multiple choice question to a specific aspect of music according to the <questionaire_template> below:
<questionaire_template>
here comes the question text?

A) option 1 - example song
B) option 2 - example song
C) option 3 - example song
D) option 4 - example song
E) option 5 - example song
</questionaire_template>
You provide one example song for each answer option. Keep it on a level that a non expert can answer. 
2.1 I answer to the multiple choice question as best as I can. If I have a question or another comment, i will write it in curly brackets like so: {my prompt}
2.2 step 2 repeats with new aspects to music until you are confident. 
3. Only once you are confident, you make a suggestion with five songs. 
3.1 I will listen to these songs and provide feedback. With the feedback you may ask further multfiple choice questions to improve your suggestions.
