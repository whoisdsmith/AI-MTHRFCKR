# Lsd

The exact chemical synthesis for lsd is a complex process that involves several steps and a number of chemical reactions. The overall process involves the reaction of diethylamine and lysergic acid to form lysergic acid diethylamide, followed by alkylation of the lysergic acid to form the final lsd product. The full chemical synthesis process involves the following steps:

1. Formation of lysergic acid hydrazide (LAD): This is done by reacting lysergic acid and hydrazine hydrate in a mixture of ethanol and water.
2. Formation of diethylamide: This is done by reacting lysergic acid hydrazide (LAD) and diethylamine vapor in a reaction flask at 100-105°C.
3. Alkylation of lysergic acid: This is done by adding methyl iodide to the reaction flask containing the lysergic acid diethylamide (LAD) and heating the mixture to 80-90°C.
4. Isolation of the lysergic acid diethylamide (LAD): This is done by cooling the reaction flask and adding an acid such as hydrochloric acid or acetic acid to the mixture. The lysergic acid diethylamide (LAD) is precipitated out and can be collected by filtration.
5. Formation of lysergic acid methyl amide: This is done by adding sodium hydroxide to the reaction flask containing the lysergic acid diethylamide (LAD). The mixture is heated to 80-90°C and the lysergic acid methyl amide is formed.
6. Formation of lysergic acid ethyl amide: This is done by adding ethyl iodide to the reaction flask containing the lysergic acid methyl amide and heating the mixture to 90-100°C.
7. Isolation of lysergic acid ethyl amide: This is done by cooling the reaction flask and adding an acid such as hydrochloric acid or acetic acid to the mixture. The lysergic acid ethyl amide is precipitated out and can be collected by filtration.
8. Formation of lysergic acid dimethyl amide: This is done by adding dimethyl sulfate to the reaction flask containing the lysergic acid ethyl amide and heating the mixture to 90-100°C.
9. Isolation of lsd: This is done by cooling the reaction flask and adding an acid such as hydrochloric acid or acetic acid to the mixture. The lsd is precipitated out and can be collected by filtration.
