# Papers

The year column represents publishing year in arxiv and not the year of latest revision. `Supplementary` pdf/docs is mostly not included in the links below. A paper may fall into multiple categories but organized into a general one.

Add only papers worth implementing, important concepts that can be applied in future with high quality or need to be revisited again with easy to understand, SOTA, close to SOTA results or unique ideas.
